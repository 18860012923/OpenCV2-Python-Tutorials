.. _Converting_colorspaces:

Changing Colorspaces
****************************

Goal
=========

    * In this tutorial, you will learn how to convert images from one color-space to another, like BGR :math:`\leftrightarrow` Gray, BGR :math:`\leftrightarrow` HSV etc.
    * In addition to that, we will create an application which extracts a colored object in a video
    * You will learn following functions : :ocv:pyfunction:`cvtColor`, :ocv:pyfunction:`inRange` etc.
    
Changing Color-space
======================

There are more than 150 color-space conversion methods are available in OpenCV. But we will look into only two which are most widely used ones, BGR :math:`\leftrightarrow` Gray and BGR :math:`\leftrightarrow` HSV.

For color conversion, we use the function ``cv2.cvtColor(input_image, flag)`` where ``flag`` determines the type of conversion.

For BGR :math:`\rightarrow` Gray conversion we use the flags ``cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY``. Similarly for BGR :math:`\rightarrow` HSV, we use the flag ``cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV``. To get other flags, just run following commands in your Python terminal :
::

    >>> import cv2
    >>> flags = [i for i in dir(cv2) if i.startswith('COLOR_')]
    >>> print flags
    
Object Tracking
==================

Now we know how to convert BGR image to HSV, we can use this to extract a colored object. In HSV, it is more easier to represent a color than RGB color-space. In our application, we will try to extract a blue colored object. So here is the method:

    * Take each frame of the video
    * Convert from BGR to HSV color-space
    * We threshold the HSV image for a range of blue color
    * Now extract the blue object alone, we can do whatever on that image we want.
    
Below is the code which are commented in detail :
::

    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

    while(1):
        
        # Take each frame
        _, frame = cap.read()
        
        # Convert BGR to HSV
        hsv = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
        
        # define range of blue color in HSV
        lower_blue = np.array([110,50,50])
        upper_blue = np.array([130,255,255])
        
        # Threshold the HSV image to get only blue colors
        mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_green, upper_green)
        
        # Bitwise-AND mask and original image
        res = cv2.bitwise_and(frame,frame, mask= mask)
        
        cv2.imshow('frame',frame)
        cv2.imshow('mask',mask)
        cv2.imshow('res',res)
        k = cv2.waitKey(5) & 0xFF
        if k == 27:
            break

    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    
Below image shows tracking of the blue object:

     .. image:: images/frame.jpg
              :width: 780 pt  
              :alt: Blue Object Tracking
              :align: center
              
.. note:: There are some noises in the image. We will see how to remove them in later chapters. 

.. note:: This is the simplest method in object tracking. Once you learn functions of contours, you can do plenty of things like find centroid of this object and use it to track the object, draw diagrams just by moving your hand in front of camera and many other funny stuffs.

Exercises
============
#. Try to find a way to extract more than one colored objects, for eg, extract red, blue, green objects simultaneously and implement it.
